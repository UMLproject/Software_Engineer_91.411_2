###**Demo**

**This folder contains screen captures of the application in action**
**Here is a preview of what a user might do:**

First, the user opens the project in NetBeans and runs it:
![Run](https://github.com/DeepBlue14/Software_Engineer_91.411_2/blob/master/2_DataAggregator/Demo/Run.png)

The opening GUI appears:
![Opening](https://github.com/DeepBlue14/Software_Engineer_91.411_2/blob/master/2_DataAggregator/Demo/Opening.png)

For the sake of easy testing, we will allow anyone to log in, even if they do not already have a account in the system:
![Login](https://github.com/DeepBlue14/Software_Engineer_91.411_2/blob/master/2_DataAggregator/Demo/Login.png)


The user may then wish to add a user to the system:
![Logo](https://github.com/DeepBlue14/Software_Engineer_91.411_2/blob/master/2_DataAggregator/Demo/AddUser.png)

the user will then be prompted to press the "Users" button again to update the table:

The user may wish to register several devices:
![Logo](https://github.com/DeepBlue14/Software_Engineer_91.411_2/blob/master/2_DataAggregator/Demo/AddDevice.png)

Again, he will be prompted to press the "Devices" button to update the table:
