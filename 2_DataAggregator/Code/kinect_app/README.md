####**Project Synopsis**
Robotic sensor administration application interface framework.  The final goal of this project is to create a [ROS][1]-based system to allow interactive communication between a sensor device and a cloud.  It is being developed for [Ubuntu][5] 12.04-15.04 *(tested with 14.04)*, although it should run on other UNIX/Linux-based systems.  This package also includes basic simulated TCP/IP message topics for imu (accelerometer), compass, image, and pointcloud types. 
**Warning: This project is currently in a Beta phase.  Expected completion date is May 4 2015.**
**Warning: Installer scripts have not yet been fully tested.  Since they make modifications on an operating systems level, we do not advise using them at this point.**


####**Dependencies**
- [Ubuntu][5] 12.04-15.04 *(tested with 14.04)*
- [ROS][1] hydro or later (catkin)
- [QT4][3] Project
- [QGLViewer][8]
- [QJson][7]
- [Boost][4]
- [SQLite][6] Database



####**Installation (Linux/ROS Version)**

Follow the instructions for installing [ROS][1].  It is strongly advised to choose
the ```ros-<version>-desktop-full``` option to install all necessary ROS packages. 
*Note: This step is not necessary for running the frontend or prototype.*

Install additional packages via ros:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-<ros_version>-sound*
sudo apt-get install ros-<ros_version>-openni*
sudo apt-get install ros-<ros_version>-openni2*
sudo apt-get install ros-<ros_version>-pocketsphinx
```

Install pocketsphinx dependency:
```
sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-gconf
```


Install the [Boost][4] C++ libraries:
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

Install [QT4][3]:
```
sudo apt-get install libqt4-*
```

Install [QGLViewer][8]:
```
sudo apt-get install libqglviewer2 libqglviewer-dev
```

Now you must make some modifications so it can be compiled
with CMake: ```sudo vim /usr/include/QGLViewer/vec.h```.  Now change
```#include <QDomElement>``` to ```#include <QtXml/QDomElement>```.
Then save and quit.  Next, run ```sudo vim /usr/include/QGLViewer/config.h```.
Change ```#include <QGLWidget>``` to ```#include <QtOpenGL/QGLWidget>```.

Install [QJson][7]
```
sudo apt-get install libqjson0 libqjson-*
```

Install [SQLite][6]
```
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```



####**Build & Run**

#####**GUI Frontend--IDEs**

*Note: This option allows the user to run the GUI frontend only.  It does not include the simulators or other modules.  This was tested on the NetBeans IDE.*
Install an IDE of your choice.
Go to an apropriate location and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/DeepBlue14/sensor-admin.git
```

- Run IDE
- Open ```sensor_admin_NB```
- Build & Run

*This project has been tested on the NetBeans IDE.  If you are using an IDE that cannot process CMake files, you may have to manually link against the dependencies (this is NOT nessisary for NetBeans):*
```
QtCore
QtGui
QtWidgets
QNetwork
QtOpenGL
QtSql
QtXml

boost_system
boost_filesystem
boost_regex
qjson
QGLViewer
sqlite3
```


#####**Entire Project**

Set up a ROS workspace:
```
mkdir -p ~/se_ws/src
cd ~/se_ws
catkin_init_workspace
catkin_make
```

Clone the package:
```
cd ~/se_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/UMLproject/Software_Engineer_91.411_2.git
cd ~/se_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make
```

####**Execution**

#####**1) Individual Nodes**

Frontend:
```
roscore
rosrun app_node main
```


Speech responsive node:
```
roslaunch speech_node voice_nav_commands.launch
rosrun sound_play soundplay_node.py
rosrun speech_node ManageNodeStatus
```


#####**2) Launch Files**

*(not yet implimented)*
```

```


#####**3) Simulations**

There are several sensor simulations.  These construct data objects of the same type they would be from sensor -> ROS.  The speed at which each simulator publishes data is currently hard-coded at a rate of 10 hz., and the data values are contained in an array.  These values/rates can be changed by the user (by going into the source file and modifying them).

Accelerometer simulator will publish ```sensor_msgs/Imu``` to
```/accelerometer/imu/sim```.  It will also print the linear acceleration
x field:
```
rosrun sensor_node AccelerometerSim
```

Image data:
```
rosrun sensor_node ImageSim
```

PointCloud2:
```
rosrun sensor_node PointCloud2Sim
```

Magnetometer:
```
rosrun sensor_node MagnetometerSim
```
